== Description ==
Display your eBay items on your own website allowing visitors to search your products and buy them easily.  Choose options and styles to suit your Wordpress theme for simple and seamless integration. You can also choose to display all of your eBay items or use a search term to filter which items are shown on your webpage. As your eBay items are on your own page you can add additional information/logos above and below to inspire customer confidence. Using our eBay plugin you can keep your customers on 'your own website' until they find what they want and are ready to make a purchase.
